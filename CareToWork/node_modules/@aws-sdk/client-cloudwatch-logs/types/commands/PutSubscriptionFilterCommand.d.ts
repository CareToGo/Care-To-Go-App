/**
 * <p>Creates or updates a subscription filter and associates it with the specified log
 *       group. Subscription filters allow you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events
 *       ingested through <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html">PutLogEvents</a> and have them delivered to a specific
 *       destination. When log events are sent to the
 *       receiving service, they are Base64 encoded
 *       and compressed with the gzip format.</p>
 *          <p>The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>An Amazon Kinesis stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter,
 *           for same-account delivery.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>A logical destination that belongs to a different account, for cross-account delivery.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the
 *           subscription filter, for same-account delivery.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>An AWS Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter,
 *           for same-account delivery.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>There can only be one subscription filter associated with a log group. If you are
 *       updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in <code>filterName</code>.
 *       Otherwise, the call fails because you cannot associate a second filter with a log
 *       group.</p>
 *          <p>To perform a <code>PutSubscriptionFilter</code> operation, you must also have the
 *       <code>iam:PassRole</code> permission.</p>
